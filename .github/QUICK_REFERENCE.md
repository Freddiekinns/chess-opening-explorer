# Quick Decision Reference

## ï¿½ Simple Development Flow
```
What are you building?
â”œâ”€ Fix a bug â†’ Direct implementation + test
â”œâ”€ Simple feature â†’ Make it work â†’ Make it clean
â”œâ”€ Complex feature â†’ Break into small parts
â””â”€ New architecture â†’ Check existing patterns first
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Code Quality Quick Checks
```
Before committing:
â”œâ”€ Does it work? â†’ Test manually
â”œâ”€ Is it readable? â†’ Clear names, simple logic
â”œâ”€ Is it secure? â†’ Validate inputs, no secrets logged
â””â”€ Is it fast? â†’ <200ms responses, mocked externals
```

## ðŸ§¹ Refactoring Signals
```
Refactor when you see:
â”œâ”€ Copy-pasted code â†’ Extract function/constant
â”œâ”€ Function >20 lines â†’ Split responsibilities
â”œâ”€ Magic numbers â†’ Create constants
â””â”€ Unclear names â†’ Rename for clarity
```

## ï¿½ Project Structure Guide
- **Frontend** (`packages/web/**`): Use simplified.css, minimal components
- **Backend** (`packages/api/**`): Simple routes, clear error handling
- **Shared** (`packages/shared/**`): Pure functions, clear types
- **CSS**: Single consolidated file with CSS variables
