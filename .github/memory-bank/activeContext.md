## Current Focus: Project Structure and Documentation

The immediate task is to establish the foundational "Memory Bank" documentation structure for the project. This involves creating and populating the core documents that define the project's goals, technical landscape, and current status.

This effort is based on the `memory-bank.instructions.md` guide.

## Recent Changes

-   Created the `.github/memory-bank/` directory.
-   Created the `.github/memory-bank/tasks` directory.
-   Created and populated the following core documents:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`

## Next Steps

1.  Create the `progress.md` file to capture the current state of completed features and known issues.
2.  Create the `tasks/_index.md` file to initialize the task tracking system.
3.  Review all created files for accuracy and completeness against the existing codebase and `memory_bank.md`.
4.  Once the structure is in place, the next logical step would be to start populating the task list with concrete work items for the next development cycle.
