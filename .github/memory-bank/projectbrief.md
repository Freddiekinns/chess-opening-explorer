# Project Brief: Chess Opening Explorer

This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the Chess Opening Explorer project.

## Core Problem

Chess players, from beginners to advanced, struggle to navigate the vast and complex world of chess openings. Existing tools are often either too simple (lacking depth) or too complex (overwhelming for non-masters). There is a need for a tool that is both powerful and easy to use, providing a clear path to understanding and choosing openings.

## Project Goals

1.  **Build a high-performance, user-friendly chess opening explorer.**
2.  Provide **intuitive search and discovery** for chess openings.
3.  Offer **curated learning resources**, such as videos and courses.
4.  Present **meaningful statistics** to help players make informed decisions.
5.  **Leverage AI** to enrich content and provide unique insights.

## Target Audience

-   **Beginner to Intermediate Players (Primary):** Players rated under 1800 who need guidance and a clear way to explore openings.
-   **Advanced Players (Secondary):** Players rated 1800+ who can use the tool for quick reference and to explore new ideas.

## Core Features

-   **Comprehensive Opening Database:** A large and accurate database of chess openings.
-   **Natural Language Search:** Allow users to search for openings using descriptive terms (e.g., "aggressive openings for black").
-   **Popularity and Performance Stats:** Show how often openings are played and how well they perform.
-   **Video Integration:** Link openings to high-quality instructional videos from trusted sources.
-   **Course Recommendations:** Suggest courses for specific openings.

## Technical Vision

-   **Frontend:** A fast, modern, and responsive web application built with React and TypeScript.
-   **Backend:** A Node.js/Express API serving data from a combination of a database and pre-processed JSON files.
-   **Data Processing:** A robust pipeline for collecting, processing, and enriching data from various sources (Lichess, YouTube, etc.).
-   **AI Integration:** Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation and analysis, with a focus on quality and accuracy.
-   **Deployment:** Serverless deployment on Vercel for scalability and ease of maintenance.
