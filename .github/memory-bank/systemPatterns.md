# System Patterns: Chess Opening Explorer

This document outlines the key architectural decisions and recurring patterns in the system.

## AD-003: Single CSS File Architecture

-   **Pattern:** All frontend styles are consolidated into a single CSS file: `/packages/web/src/styles/simplified.css`.
-   **Rationale:**
    -   Eliminates CSS specificity wars and ordering issues.
    -   Ensures a single, small, cacheable CSS bundle.
    -   Simplifies theming and maintenance through the extensive use of CSS variables.
-   **Strict Rule:** Developers **must not** create new CSS files. All new styles are appended to `simplified.css`.

## AD-004: Channel-First Video Pipeline

-   **Pattern:** Instead of searching YouTube for videos based on opening names (which is expensive and inaccurate), the pipeline first indexes all videos from a curated list of trusted chess channels. Openings are then mapped to these videos.
-   **Rationale:**
    -   Drastically reduces YouTube Data API quota usage (by over 99%).
    -   Ensures a high-quality, relevant baseline of video content.
    -   Avoids the "garbage in, garbage out" problem of open-ended video search.
-   **Implementation:** `tools/production/run-channel-first-pipeline.js`.

## AD-005: Conservative AI Content Policy

-   **Pattern:** AI-generated content is treated with skepticism, especially URLs and factual claims. A principle of "if in doubt, exclude it" is applied.
-   **Rationale:** Early experiments revealed a high hallucination rate for URLs (95%+) and factual inaccuracies. The value of AI is in discovery and summarization, not as a source of truth.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   AI is used for tasks like generating strategic summaries or identifying themes.
    -   AI-generated URLs or direct links are almost always discarded.
    -   Validation scripts (`tools/validation/`) are used to check the integrity of AI-generated data before it's committed to the production dataset.

## AD-006: Idempotent Data Processing

-   **Pattern:** All data processing scripts in the `tools/` directory are designed to be idempotent. They can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial run.
-   **Rationale:** This makes the data pipeline robust and recoverable. If a script fails midway, it can be safely re-run without duplicating data or causing side effects.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Scripts check for the existence of output files before starting.
    -   Processing status and metadata are stored separately from the content itself.
    -   "Skip" logic is implemented to bypass items that have already been successfully processed.

## AD-008: Progressive Discovery Search

-   **Pattern:** The search functionality uses a multi-layered approach to understand user intent, moving from broad concepts to specific results.
-   **Hierarchy:**
    1.  **Semantic Search:** Understands natural language queries (e.g., "attacking openings for black").
    2.  **Fuzzy Search:** Tolerates typos and variations in opening names.
    3.  **Exact Match:** Provides a direct hit for specific ECO codes or names.
-   **Rationale:** This creates a more intuitive and powerful discovery experience than simple text matching, guiding users to relevant openings even if they don't know the precise terminology.

## Monorepo Deployment on Vercel

-   **Pattern:** The project uses a dual-directory structure for the API to work with Vercel's serverless environment.
    -   The "real" API logic, services, and data reside in `packages/api`.
    -   A thin wrapper layer exists in the root `api/` directory. Each file in `api/` is a Vercel serverless function that simply imports and exports the corresponding route handler from `packages/api`.
-   **Rationale:** This pattern allows for a clean monorepo structure with shared packages (`packages/shared`) while complying with Vercel's build and deployment model. The `vercel.json` file orchestrates this.

## AD-009: Unified Card Header Pattern

- **Pattern:** Consistent header block (`.card-header`) with optional vertical accent bar pseudo-element (`.card-header__title--accent::before`) and metadata (e.g., ECO pill) right-aligned.
- **Rationale:** Establishes visual hierarchy without oversized headings; accent provides subtle section anchoring while reducing cognitive load vs multiple heading sizes. Right-aligning metadata reduces competition with primary title text.
- **Implementation Details:** Single CSS file (`simplified.css`), softened gradient (rgba(232,93,4,0.88) â†’ rgba(232,93,4,0.18)). ECO pill de-emphasized via opacity; tooltip (`title` + `aria-label`) for accessibility.
- **Considerations:** Future tokenization of gradient stops & width; conditional accent suppression in dense stacks.

## AD-010: JS-Driven Height Animation for Progressive Disclosure

- **Pattern:** Expand/collapse transitions use measured element heights instead of CSS max-height tricks.
- **Rationale:** Symmetric animation (expand & collapse), avoids layout thrash and timing mismatch when content height is dynamic; cleaner accessibility fallback.
- **Implementation Details:** Measure `wrapper.scrollHeight` pre/post state toggle; set explicit start/end heights; clear inline style after transition; guard with `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable motion; fallback timeout to ensure cleanup even if `transitionend` not fired.
- **Pitfalls Avoided:** No simultaneous animation on child list (prevents early content pop-in); avoids partially visible rows formerly hidden by gradient.
- **Future Enhancements:** Optional fade/stagger for newly revealed rows, caching last expanded height if performance becomes a concern (currently negligible).

## AD-011: Test Runner Separation (Backend vs Frontend)

- **Pattern:** Backend/server logic tested with Jest under the root `tests/` directory; frontend React component/UI tests reside within `packages/web` and use Vitest. No Vitest tests live under root; no Jest tests target `packages/web` client code.
- **Rationale:** Prevents overlapping globals (`jest` vs `vi`), simplifies tooling configs, and accelerates frontend test runs via Vite-powered Vitest while keeping backend coverage thresholds enforced by Jest.
- **Implementation Details:** Removed duplicate root UI test (`tests/unit/related-openings-ui.test.tsx`) after migrating to package-local Vitest tests. Root Jest config excludes `packages/web`. Frontend tests import `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` (or equivalent) as needed.
- **Guideline:** New UI/component tests must be added under `packages/web/src/**/__tests__/`. Any backend/service tests go under `tests/` (unit, integration). Avoid cross-runner mocking patterns.
- **Future Considerations:** Optionally add separate `npm run test:watch:web` alias; consider coverage reporting for frontend if desired (Vitest coverage) aggregated in CI.
