# [TASK001] - Implement Memory Bank Structure

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-09-06
**Updated:** 2025-09-06

## Original Request
The user requested to "Review the codebase and implement the memorybank structure you can use the original file + review the code to create the structure as outlined".

## Thought Process
The goal is to create the set of core documentation files as specified in `.github/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md`. This will provide a foundational "memory" for the AI agent to understand the project's context, architecture, and status between sessions.

The process involves:
1.  Reading and understanding the `memory-bank.instructions.md` file to identify the required file structure.
2.  Reviewing the existing `memory_bank.md` and the overall project structure to gather the necessary information.
3.  Creating each required file with content synthesized from the project artifacts.
4.  Organizing the files in the `.github/memory-bank/` directory.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create the directory `.github/memory-bank/tasks`.
- [x] Create `projectbrief.md` with the project's core mission and goals.
- [x] Create `productContext.md` to explain the "why" behind the project.
- [x] Create `techContext.md` to document the technology stack.
- [x] Create `systemPatterns.md` to outline key architectural decisions.
- [x] Create `activeContext.md` to describe the current task.
- [x] Create `progress.md` to summarize the project's current state.
- [x] Create `tasks/_index.md` to initialize the task management system.
- [x] Create this task file, `TASK001-implement-memory-bank-structure.md`.
- [x] Mark this task as complete.
