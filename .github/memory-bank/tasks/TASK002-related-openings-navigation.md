# [TASK002] - Related Openings Navigation (ECO/Mainline Links)

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-09-07  
**Updated:** 2025-09-08 (Final consolidation + animation + design system unification complete)  

## Original Request
Enable improved chess opening exploration from an opening detail page:
- Show other openings sharing the same ECO code.
- Provide a direct link to the mainline (if current is a variation).
- Future phase: related by name (phase 2), possibly richer relationships later.
Need planning, UI approach options, possibly a dummy prototype first.

## Completion Summary
Implemented and later refined a hybrid + ultimately consolidated Related Openings experience:
1. Initial Hybrid (Teaser + Tab) delivering discoverability and full exploration.  
2. Final Consolidation: Removed separate tab/modal approach in favor of a single inline expandable teaser with progressive disclosure.  
3. Interaction polish: Replaced CSS-only max-height with JS measured height animation (expand + collapse symmetry, reduced-motion safe path, transition cleanup).  
4. Visual refinement: Removed gradient fade artifact, standardized collapsed preview (4 rows incl. mainline), unified card header design language, softened accent bar gradient.  
5. Accessibility & semantics: `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, focus management, aria-live announcements retained where applicable, ECO pill tooltip (`title` + `aria-label`).  
6. Metadata clarity: ECO pill repositioned (right-aligned), de-emphasized (opacity) to reduce visual noise while preserving context.  
7. Component reuse: `VariationItem` + card header pattern reduce duplication and align with system patterns.  
8. Stability: All related openings tests (navigation, structure, UI) passing after each iteration (latest: 7/7).  

## Deliverables Achieved
- Backend endpoint `/api/openings/fen/:fen/related` with tests (mainline, variation, 404).  
- Frontend hook `useRelatedOpenings`.  
- Components: `RelatedOpeningsTeaser` (now primary), legacy `RelatedOpeningsTab` (superseded), `VariationItem`.  
- Mainline contextual callout (variation context only) preserved.  
- Fixed sorting by `games_analyzed` (descending) + descriptor copy.  
- JS-driven height animation for expand/collapse (+ reduced-motion fallback).  
- Unified card header pattern + accent bar (softened gradient) + ECO pill alignment/dimming.  
- Accessibility: aria semantics, aria-live (as needed), focus preservation, tooltip metadata.  
- Responsive layout maintained; grid needs minimal adaptation post-consolidation.  
- Comprehensive tests: navigation, structure, skeleton, error states, expand behavior, accessibility callout, animation stability (indirect).  

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** 100% Complete

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Backend Contract & Endpoint | Complete | Stable response: { current, mainline, siblings, counts, ecoCode } |
| Data Hook | Complete | `useRelatedOpenings` robust against null data |
| Hybrid UI (Teaser + Tab) | Complete | Implemented & tested |
| Navigation Refactor | Complete | Legacy path bug resolved (/opening/:fen) |
| Contextual Mainline Callout | Complete | Variation-only display |
| Sorting Descriptor | Complete | Static text implemented |
| Responsive Grid | Complete | CSS classes added (variation-grid) |
| Accessibility (Phase 1) | Complete | aria-labelledby, aria-live expand, role note |
| Tests (Backend + Frontend) | Complete | All pass post-refactor |
| Documentation | Complete | TASK002 + TASK003 + memory bank updated |
| Out of Scope deferrals | Documented | Win rates, compare, alt sorting, analytics |

## Deferred / Future Ideas
| Idea | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Name similarity + synonyms | Broader exploration beyond ECO grouping |
| Analytics instrumentation | Measure engagement & optimize layout |
| Move snippet previews | Speed recognition of lines |
| Lazy rendering for very large ECO sets | Performance safeguard |
| Tokenize accent bar (CSS vars) | Easier theming / conditional suppression |
| Shared Tooltip component | Consistent ARIA + styling reuse |
| Semantic heading audit | Ensure optimal document outline |
| Staggered row fade-in | Optional subtle motion polish |

## Acceptance Criteria (Met)
1. Discoverable subset + CTA – DONE.  
2. Full exploration path (initially tab, later integrated) – DONE.  
3. Fixed sorting by games analyzed; descriptor explains – DONE.  
4. Mainline callout present only when viewing variation – DONE.  
5. SPA navigation to `/opening/:fen` – DONE.  
6. Accessible semantics & screen reader support – DONE.  
7. Smooth expand/collapse animation (JS) – DONE.  
8. Unified design language (card header, accent refinement) – DONE.  

## Key Files
- `api/openings.js` (endpoint logic) [unchanged in latest refinement]
- `packages/web/src/useRelatedOpenings.ts`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTeaser.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTab.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/VariationItem.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-navigation.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-structure.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-ui.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/styles/simplified.css` (new related classes)

## Notes
No performance regressions observed (tests steady, animation overhead minimal due to single height transition). Abstractions reduce duplication and support future analytics & motion enhancements. This document is the baseline for any subsequent expansion tasks.

## Closure
Task closed. Open a new task (TASK00X) for any future related openings enhancements.

## Final Progress Log Addendum (2025-09-08)
- Removed redundant tab/modal path; consolidated inline teaser as sole UI.
- Replaced CSS max-height animation with JS-driven measured height for symmetry (expand + collapse) and reduced-motion respect.
- Eliminated gradient fade + partial row artifact; standardized collapsed preview to 4 rows including mainline.
- Introduced unified card header pattern; softened accent bar gradient for less visual weight.
- Right-aligned and de-emphasized ECO pill (opacity) + added tooltip (`title` + `aria-label`).
- Ensured all 7 targeted related openings tests passing post-refactor.
- Updated memory bank (active context, system patterns pending) to reflect design system alignment.

## Release Summary (Final)
**Total Files Affected:** 4 (core phase) + subsequent refinements across 2 primary files.

### Files Created (Phase Origin)
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTeaser.tsx` – Teaser component (now primary UI).
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTab.tsx` – Legacy full list (superseded by consolidation).
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/VariationItem.tsx` – Shared rendering abstraction.

### Files Modified (Refinement Phase)
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTeaser.tsx` – Consolidation, animation, accessibility, ECO pill updates.
- `packages/web/src/styles/simplified.css` – Header pattern, accent bar, teaser styles, animation support, softened gradient.

### Dependencies & Infrastructure
- No new runtime dependencies added.
- Testing unchanged; existing Vitest setup sufficient.

### Risk & Mitigation
- Animation: JS height measurement kept minimal; reduced-motion guard prevents adverse accessibility impact.
- Legacy tab component retained (can be removed in cleanup if desired) to minimize regression risk during transition.
