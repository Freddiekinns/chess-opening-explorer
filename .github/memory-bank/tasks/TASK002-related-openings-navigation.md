# [TASK002] - Related Openings Navigation (ECO/Mainline Links)

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete  
**Added:** 2025-09-07  
**Updated:** 2025-09-07 (Phase 1 structural + accessibility refinements completed via TASK003)  

## Original Request
Enable improved chess opening exploration from an opening detail page:
- Show other openings sharing the same ECO code.
- Provide a direct link to the mainline (if current is a variation).
- Future phase: related by name (phase 2), possibly richer relationships later.
Need planning, UI approach options, possibly a dummy prototype first.

## Current Completion Summary (Phase 1)
Implemented hybrid Related Openings experience:
- Inline Teaser: mainline (when applicable) + top 3 variations + View All CTA.
- Dedicated Tab: full list with truncation -> expand, responsive two-column grid, static sort descriptor, contextual mainline callout, aria-live announcements.
- SPA navigation (no reload) using react-router `navigate`.
- Accessibility: semantic regions, list roles, aria-live polite feedback for expand/collapse, contextual callout with role=note.
- Reusable `VariationItem` component unifies teaser and tab markup.
- Clear exclusion of win rates, compare view, and alternative sorting per confirmed scope.

## Phase 1 Deliverables Achieved
- Backend endpoint `/api/openings/fen/:fen/related` with tests (mainline, variation, 404).
- Frontend hook `useRelatedOpenings`.
- Components: `RelatedOpeningsTeaser`, `RelatedOpeningsTab`, `VariationItem`.
- Mainline contextual callout (variation context only).
- Fixed sorting by `games_analyzed` (descending) + descriptor copy.
- Expand/collapse with aria-live announcements.
- Responsive grid (>=760px two columns) for variations list.
- Test coverage: navigation, structure, skeleton, error states, expand behavior, accessibility callout.

## Updated Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Core + Structural Refinement). Future phases pending new task files.

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Backend Contract & Endpoint | Complete | Stable response: { current, mainline, siblings, counts, ecoCode } |
| Data Hook | Complete | `useRelatedOpenings` robust against null data |
| Hybrid UI (Teaser + Tab) | Complete | Implemented & tested |
| Navigation Refactor | Complete | Legacy path bug resolved (/opening/:fen) |
| Contextual Mainline Callout | Complete | Variation-only display |
| Sorting Descriptor | Complete | Static text implemented |
| Responsive Grid | Complete | CSS classes added (variation-grid) |
| Accessibility (Phase 1) | Complete | aria-labelledby, aria-live expand, role note |
| Tests (Backend + Frontend) | Complete | All pass post-refactor |
| Documentation | Complete | TASK002 + TASK003 updated |
| Out of Scope deferrals | Documented | Win rates, compare, alt sorting, analytics |

## Deferred / Future Phases (Not Started)
| Future Phase Idea | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Name similarity + synonyms | Broader exploration beyond ECO grouping |
| Tab persistence (session/localStorage) | UX continuity after navigation |
| Analytics instrumentation | Measure engagement & optimize layout |
| Move snippet previews | Speed recognition of lines |
| Lazy rendering for very large ECO sets | Performance safeguard |
| Micro animations (expand/collapse transitions) | Visual polish |

## Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria (Met)
1. Teaser shows discoverable subset + CTA – DONE.
2. Tab lists all variations with truncation & expansion – DONE.
3. Fixed sorting by games analyzed; descriptor explains – DONE.
4. Mainline callout present only when viewing variation – DONE.
5. SPA navigation to `/opening/:fen` – DONE.
6. Accessible semantics & screen reader announcements – DONE.

## Key Files
- `api/openings.js` (endpoint logic) [unchanged in latest refinement]
- `packages/web/src/useRelatedOpenings.ts`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTeaser.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/RelatedOpeningsTab.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/VariationItem.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-navigation.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-structure.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/detail/__tests__/related-openings-ui.test.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/styles/simplified.css` (new related classes)

## Notes
No performance regressions observed in tests (lightweight changes). Abstraction reduces duplication and prepares for future analytics hooks. Future tasks should start from this documented baseline.

## Closure
Phase 1 is closed. Open a new task (TASK00X) to pursue any future scope items.
