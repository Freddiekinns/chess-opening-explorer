# TASK003 - Related Openings Hybrid Teaser Refinement

**Status:** Complete  
**Added:** 2025-09-07  
**Updated:** 2025-09-07  

## Original Request
Refine the hybrid related openings UI (teaser + tab) to align with design system, improve navigation (SPA), accessibility, hierarchy, and clarity while keeping decisions: no win rates, no compare view, fixed sorting by games analyzed.

## Thought Process
The teaser currently provides discovery but visually underperforms versus design system components. Navigation relies on window.location causing full reload. We incrementally refactored to use router navigation, add clearer hierarchy, semantics, and prepare for future analytics without overengineering.

## Implementation Plan (Executed Phase 1)
 1. SPA navigation (teaser & tab) via useNavigate.
 2. Teaser markup restructure (header, mainline item, list, footer CTA).
 3. Accessibility semantics (section+aria-labelledby, ul/li list semantics).
 4. Descriptor text for sorting rationale.
 5. Consistent BEM-ish class naming.
 6. Focus compatibility via existing global focus styles (no custom additions needed yet).
 7. Navigation tests updated (/opening/:fen path).
 8. Logic unchanged (sorting, top 3 cap, conditional mainline).
 9. Added mainline contextual callout in tab for variation context.
 10. Added static sort descriptor bar (fixed sort explanation).
 11. Variation grid layout (responsive 1 -> 2 columns at 760px).
 12. Extracted reusable VariationItem component (teaser & tab share logic).
 13. Added aria-live polite region announcing expand/collapse state.
 14. Added new CSS classes (variation-grid, variation-item, mainline-callout, sort-descriptor, teaser block styles, sr-only).
 15. Added new structural + accessibility tests (callout, expand, navigation, skeleton, error states).

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** 100% (Phase 1 Complete)

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-07
- Completed all planned Phase 1 structural, accessibility, and styling enhancements for the hybrid related openings UI.
- Introduced VariationItem abstraction to reduce duplication and unify semantics.
- Implemented responsive grid and mainline contextual guidance pattern.
- Added aria-live announcements improving SR feedback for expand/collapse.
- Extended test coverage (navigation, structure, skeleton, error, expand, callout).
- Full suite pass after resolving router context requirement in legacy tests.

## Release Summary
The Related Openings hybrid UI now:
- Provides consistent SPA navigation without full reloads.
- Clarifies context when viewing a variation via a mainline callout.
- Communicates fixed sorting policy explicitly (descriptor + static bar).
- Scales variation display with responsive grid and accessible list semantics.
- Announces dynamic expand/collapse actions to assistive tech.
- Shares a single reusable item component for teaser and tab, reducing maintenance.

No win rates, comparison view, or sorting toggles were introduced (per scope). Performance impact minimal (lightweight component extraction). Future phases can layer analytics, persistence, and motion without structural churn.

## Next Suggested Steps (Future Phase Candidates)
- Persist last active tab across sessions.
- Lazy-load expanded variation segments for very large sets.
- Add inline move snippets or preview PGNs (if data available later).
- Instrument analytics events (view teaser impressions, expand actions, navigation clicks).
- Micro-interaction animations (fade/height transition on expand).

## Completion
Phase 1 complete and ready for integration review.
