## üìÇ Project Structure

The project uses a monorepo structure to manage the different parts of the application:

```
/packages/
  /api/     - Backend services (Node.js/Express)
  /shared/  - Shared types/utilities (TypeScript)
  /web/     - Frontend application (React/Vite)
/data/      - Core operational data
  videos.sqlite           - Main database (openings, videos, relationships)
  popularity_stats.json   - Complete opening statistics (12,377 positions)
  opening_popularity_data.json - Top 185 ranked openings
  channel_first_index.json - YouTube video metadata cache
  /eco/                   - ECO classification data with AI analysis
  /course_analysis/       - Course recommendation cache
/public/api/openings/     - Individual opening files for frontend serving
/tools/     - Data processing and utility scripts
  /video-pipeline/ - Modern video matching pipeline (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
  /production/     - Production data processing scripts
  /analysis/       - Data analysis and validation tools
  /utilities/      - General utility scripts
/tests/     - Integration tests
/docs/      - Comprehensive project documentation
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** from the project root:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Download ECO data**:
    This command populates the `data/eco` directory with the necessary chess opening files.
    ```bash
    npm run eco:import
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Copy the example environment file. This is required for the LLM enrichment features.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit `.env` and add your Google Cloud credentials.

### Running the Application

Start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
-   **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3001`
-   **Frontend App**: `http://localhost:3000`

### Running Tests

Execute the entire test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Development Roadmap

The project has a clean, high-performance architecture and is ready for new features. Our current roadmap includes:

-   **‚úÖ F03: Course Recommendation Data Pipeline**: Manually curate and integrate expert course recommendations. **(COMPLETED)**
