## **1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the requirements for an automated, AI-powered data enrichment pipeline to identify, vet, and integrate high-quality online chess course recommendations into the application. This system will programmatically analyze chess openings, use a large language model (LLM) to find and rank relevant courses from across the web, and integrate this data into a format that can be served instantly to the user.

**Implementation Note:** The original vision of fully automated course discovery was refined during implementation to include a hybrid approach with manual URL verification, ensuring 100% data accuracy while maintaining AI-powered course discovery capabilities.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Chess players looking to deepen their understanding of an opening face a chaotic and untrustworthy market of online courses. Manually searching for content is plagued by:

1.  **Information Overload:** A simple search yields hundreds of low-quality blogs, ads, and videos, making it difficult to find professional courses.
2.  **Quality Uncertainty:** Users cannot easily distinguish high-quality courses taught by experts from mediocre content by unvetted instructors.
3.  **Discovery Gap:** Users are often unaware of the best resources available on premium platforms like Chessable, Chessly, or ChessBase for a specific opening they are studying in our app.
4.  **Fragmented Learning Paths:** Users struggle to find comprehensive, structured learning paths that progress from basic opening principles to advanced variations.

Our application, with its existing AI-enriched opening database and proven LLM pipeline (F01), is perfectly positioned to solve this by acting as a trusted, expert curator.

## **9. Technical Architecture & Data Schemas**

### **LLM Configuration**
```javascript
// LLM Service Configuration for Gemini 2.5 Pro
const MODEL_CONFIG = {
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
  location: "us-central1", 
  projectId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID,
  temperature: 0.1, // Low temperature for consistent, factual output
  maxOutputTokens: 2048,
  enableWebGrounding: true, // Essential for course discovery
  safetySettings: "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
};
```

### **Cost Management Configuration**
```javascript
const COST_CONTROLS = {
  maxCostPerRun: 10.00, // $10 safety limit
  batchSize: 10, // Configurable batch processing
  enableCostTracking: true,
  alertThreshold: 0.80 // Alert at 80% of budget
};
```

### **Updated Course Data Schema (Implemented)**
```typescript
// Simplified, High-Accuracy Schema
interface Course {
  course_title: string;
  author: string;
  platform: string;
  repertoire_for: "White" | "Black" | "Both";
  scope: "Generalist" | "Specialist" | "System";
  anchor_fens: string[];              // FEN positions this course applies to
  
  // Manual Enrichment Fields (Added by human verification)
  verified_url?: string;              // Only if manually verified
  publication_year?: number;          // Only if manually verified
  estimated_level?: "Beginner" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced" | "Master";
  manual_notes?: string;              // Human-added notes
  manually_verified: boolean;         // Always true for production data
  verified_on: string;                // ISO 8601 timestamp
}
```

**Removed Fields (Due to Hallucination Issues):**
- `source_url` (95% hallucination rate)
- `vetting_notes` (fabricated content)  
- `quality_score` (fabricated social proof)
- `last_verified_on` (replaced with manual verification timestamps)
```

### **Final Output Schema**
```typescript
interface CourseAnalysisOutput {
  analysis_for_opening: {
    rank: number;
    name: string;
    fen: string;
  };
  found_courses: Course[];
}
```

### **Integrated Courses Database Schema**
```typescript
// packages/api/src/data/courses.json
interface CourseDatabase {
  [fen: string]: Course[];
}
```

### **Updated Directory Structure (Implemented)**

## 11. Data Maintenance & Freshness Strategy (Updated)

### **Implemented Approach**
The manual URL enrichment workflow provides inherent data freshness through human verification. Each course includes:
- `manually_verified: true` flag
- `verified_on: ISO 8601 timestamp` 
- Human-verified URLs and metadata

### **Quality Assurance Process**
1. **AI Discovery:** Finds course titles, authors, and platforms with 100% accuracy
2. **Manual Verification:** Human validates URLs, adds metadata, excludes non-existent courses
3. **Comprehensive Validation:** Automated tools verify FEN formats, URL accessibility, and data integrity
4. **Conservative Filtering:** "If in doubt, exclude it" prevents false positives

### **Future Maintenance Plan**
- **Re-verification Pipeline:** Periodic manual review of URLs and course availability
- **Automated Monitoring:** Tools can flag courses with broken URLs or changed content
- **Incremental Updates:** New openings can be processed through the established hybrid workflow

**Cost-Effective Approach:** Manual verification scales better than AI re-verification for URL accuracy, ensuring long-term data quality without recurring AI costs for false positives.
